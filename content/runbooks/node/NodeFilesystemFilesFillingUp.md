# NodeFilesystemFilesFillingUp

## Meaning

This alert is similar to the [NodeFilesystemSpaceFillingUp][1] alert, but
predicts the filesystem will run out of inodes rather than bytes of storage
space. The alert fires at a `critical` level when the filesystem is predicted to
run out of available inodes within four hours.

## Impact

A node's filesystem becoming full can have a far reaching impact, as it may
cause any or all of the applications scheduled to that node to experience
anything from performance degradation to full inoperability. Depending on the
node and filesystem involved, this could pose a critical threat to the stability
of the cluster.

## Diagnosis

Note the `instance` and `mountpoint` labels from the alert. You can graph the
usage history of this filesystem with the following query in the OpenShift web
console:

```text
node_filesystem_files_free{
  instance="<value of instance label from alert>",
  mountpoint="<value of mountpoint label from alert>"
}
```

You can also open a debug session on the node and use the standard Linux
utilities to locate the source of the usage:

```console
$ MOUNT_POINT='<value of mountpoint label from alert>'
$ NODE_NAME='<value of instance label from alert>'

$ oc debug "node/$NODE_NAME"
$ df -hi "/host/$MOUNT_POINT"
```

Note that in many cases a filesystem running out of inodes will still have
available storage. Running out of inodes is often caused by many many small
files being created by an application.

## Mitigation

The number of inodes allocated to a filesystem is usually based on the storage
size. You may be able to solve the problem, or buy time, by increasing size of
the storage volume. Otherwise, determine the application that is creating large
numbers of files and adjust its configuration or provide it dedicated storage.
