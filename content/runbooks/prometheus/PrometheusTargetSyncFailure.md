# PrometheusTargetSyncFailure

## Meaning

This alert is triggered when at least one of the Prometheus instances has
consistently failed to sync its configuration.

## Impact

Metrics and alerts may be missing or inaccurate.

## Diagnosis

Determine whether the alert is for the cluster or user workload Prometheus by
inspecting the alert's `namespace` label.

Check the logs for the appropriate Prometheus instance:

```console
$ NAMESPACE='<value of namespace label from alert>'

$ oc -n $NAMESPACE logs -l 'app=prometheus'
level=error ... msg="Creating target failed" ...
```

## Mitigation

If the logs indicate a syntax or other configuration error, correct the
corresponding `ServiceMonitor`, `PodMonitor`, or other configuration
resource. In most all cases, the operator should prevent this from happening.
